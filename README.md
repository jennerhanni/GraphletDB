# GraphletJS

## Introduction

GraphletJS is a JavaScript library for managing property graph databases. The library expects to work with a flat list of objects called nodes, where each node has certain properties based on its label. 

The library provides functions to add and remove nodes, update nodes in place, add and remove label-associated properties, create a new node of an existing label, and validate that a list meets the basic requirements of the GraphletJS schema.  

## Installation

```
npm install --save graphletjs
```

## Usage

```
const { aboutGraphlet } = require('graphletjs');
aboutGraphlet(); // This will log "GraphletJS v0.0.1" to the console
```
